                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Petter Rønning. I am a 30-year-old, creative, forward-thinking, and engaged professional currently residing in Trondheim. My passion lies in finding innovative solutions and providing value to the projects I work on. Here’s a brief overview of my journey so far.</p>
    
                <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                <p>Since 2019, I have worked as an authorized financial advisor at DNB, focusing on providing advisory services to DNB employees and managing specific customer segments. In addition, I have been part of DNB's talent program, showcasing my skills in problem-solving and leadership. Prior to this, I worked as a customer advisor at Telenor, and have extensive experience in customer service and consultation roles.</p>
    
                <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
                <p>Outside of work, I enjoy diving into new technologies, particularly in the world of Front-End Development, a subject I am currently studying at Noroff. I love problem-solving, and my experiences in IT operations and information security at NTNU have sharpened my technical skills. Besides that, I have a background in politics, where I actively contributed to local and regional decision-making.</p>
